# Operations Repository
This is the operations repo. The application repo can be found [here](https://github.com/sdelements/lets-chat). You will want to fork the application repo and use that with Atlas.


Make sure that you have created a new project in GCE with the name letschat-example-YOURATLASUSERNAME. You will also need to click credentials under API&Auth in the sidebar, click add credentials, select service account, check json, click create, and copy the file as account.json in both the packer and terraform directory.
